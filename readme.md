# Supervised LLM Uncertainty Estimation & Quantification

This paper contains all the code used in the paper: "Uncertainty Estimation and Quantification for LLMs: A Simple Supervised Approach".

For now, the code is not well prepared and please see `dev` branch for our implementation details. We would soon rearrange our code for a more convenient reproduction of the paper experiments.

All the data used in our paper are open-sourced and available at huggingface or their project homepage.
